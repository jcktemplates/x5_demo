We have created a cms engine for website x5 evolution, purely created in php, jquery and javascript, You can view how it works here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyWWx4QprTI specifically designed for website x5 evolution 9 and 10 (http://www.websitex5.com/en/index.php) the demo site which was created by website x5 evolution 10 and then converted with wavecms engine is here http://www.jckentertainment.com/demo/x5_demo/ login is username: Admin password is graham08 more information will be available once you join us.

I have used website x5 evolution for over 5 years and it has come along away, it comes completely mobile responsive, allows you to embed jquery into the actual software itself

Alot of peole are now complaining about a lack of cms functionality for this software so we decide to do some thing about it see above for link and details.

We need to add more features to the wavecms backend and to get rid of all the bugs in the cms, we are looking for anyone with php, programming knowledge, jquery, javascript and more.
